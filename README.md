Device Type Handler for the MyQ garage door opener integration for SmartThings

### Pre-requisites
Must have a Samsung SmartThings account setup (https://account.smartthings.com)
Must have a MyQ account setup (https://myq.com)

### To integrate this into SmartThings, you'll follow these steps:
Start by logging into to your SmartThings account

### 2 AVAILABLE OPTIONS
- Device Type Handler: recognizes as a DOOR
- Device Type handler: recognizes as a SWITCH (this works with Alexa voice commands and routines - 2019-12-08, OBSOLETE AS OF 2021-01-25)

### 1. My Device Handlers
1. Navigation, click on _My Device handlers_.
2. Click on [+ Create new Device handler].
3. Select the _From Code_ tab.
  - **DOOR DTH**  - devicetypehandler-myq.groovy
  - **SWITCH DTH**  - devicetypehandler-switch.groovy (OBSOLETE AS OF 2021-01-25)
4. Copy and paste in the code from the selected file.
5. Click [Create].
6. Once the page reloads, towards the top right corner, click [Save].
7. Click [Publish] -> [For Me].

#### 2. My Devices
1. Navigation, click on _My Devices_.
2. Click [+ New Device].
3. Create the new device as such:
  - Name: MyQ Garage Door Opener
  - Label: MyQ Garage Door Opener
  - Zigbee Id: <blank>
  - Device network Id: myq01
  - Type: DB Dev - MyQ Garage Door Opener
  - Version: Published
  - Location: Home
  - Hub: SmartThings Hub
  - Group: <blank>
4. Then click [Create].
5. Once the page reloads, scroll down to the Preferences row and click [edit].
6. Populate your MyQ Username/Email Address and MyQ Password, then click [Save].

### Test MyQ Device Setup
1. Navigation, click on _My Device Handlers_.
2. Click on _MyQ Garage Door Opener_.
3. On the top right side, click [Simulator <].
4. For Location, select _Home_, then click [Set Location].
5. For Preferences, for Choose a device to test with, select _MyQ Garage Door Opener_, then click [Install].
6. You'll be presented with the following buttons:
- Refresh: [refresh]: this button will query the status of your garage door (open, closed)
- Door Control: [open] [close]: these buttons will either open or close your garage door opener
- Garage Door Contrl: [open] [close]: basically the same thing as Door Control
- Health Check: [ping]: option which is setup ActionTiles to work properly
- Raw: comment window: nothing to do here
If all of your tests work properly above, then you should be GTG to add this to your SmartThings app.

### DEBUGGING/TROUBLESHOOTING
If you edit the device type handler in your SmartThings environment, search for the "refresh()" function and enable debugging by setting the following:  
```groovy
set_DEBUG("off")
...to...
set_DEBUG("on")
```

### DISCLOSURE
I am not SmartThings developer, I just did this because I couldn't get the other (way more advanced) MyQ garage door opener SmartApp that's out there to work with my system, so I created one myself.  It works well for me and this isn't for sale, so feel free to use it, tweak it, whatever you want!
Also, the apps seems to _look better_ in the Classic app.  For some reason, the new SmartThings app has a lot of extra settings that I can't seem to get rid of, but it should still work as expected!

Enjoy!
